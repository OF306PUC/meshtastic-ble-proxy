 * upstream_session — the proxy's single config session with the node.
 *
 * At boot the proxy issues its OWN want_config (its own nonce) to the node over
 * UART, consumes the ordered FromRadio burst into config_cache, and on the
 * matching config_complete_id marks the cache ready and goes LIVE. Phones that
 * connect before the cache is ready are queued PENDING and served once ready.
 * See ADR-001 (State machines, Module plan, Phase 0).
 *
 * Threading: all entry points run on the single Zephyr system work queue (the
 * UART RX callback path and the BLE callback path are both work-queue context).
 * No mutexes; state is a plain enum mutated only from that single context.
 *
 * NOTE: this module has NO dependency on ble_gatt. It only references
 * `struct bt_conn` (an opaque BT-stack type) and stubs the per-phone replay
 * (Task C wires the real replay into ble_gatt).
